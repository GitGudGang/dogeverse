# Databases for Developers - Final Project

## The assignment is to develop the backend part of a web application with three databases. 
You need to implement 3 solutions:  
➢Relational database  
➢Document database  
➢Graph database  

### The project should contain the following elements:  
➢Database design for all three databases  
➢ERD of the relational database  
➢Test data in all tables  
➢Protection from SQL injection  
➢Transactions  
➢Stored objects (Views, Stored procedures, Stored functions, Triggers, Events)  
➢An audit solution involving these triggers  
➢Definition of users and privileges at database level (admin, read only user, user with limited read privileges, application with minimum functional privileges)  
➢A CRUD application with search options, and optionally some queries relating to business logic  
➢API (documentation with Swagger or similar)  
➢Cloud deployment (optional)  
➢Integration tests (between the backend and databases)  
➢Documentation 

### General Requirements:    
➢Databases should be complex enough to cover the curriculum of the whole course. For example, a relational database should have at least 10 tables.  
➢Not all functionality needs to be implemented for all three databases.  
➢The focus will be on the database and the backend server. Frontend is not part of the project. Use Postman, Swagger UI, etc. to simulate the interaction with a web client.
➢Databases can be hosted on the same web server or different ones.  
➢Choice of tech stack is up to the group.  

### Project Delivery:  
➢Individually to WISEflow.  
➢Project Report that serves as information to the external censor. Report structure in the full assignment document.    
➢A link to the code base in a publicly accessible repository.  
➢Relational database scripts.  
➢Dump file of the document database and Script for loading the test data.  
➢Dump file of the graph database and Script for loading the test data.  
➢A brief installation guide that specifies how to organise the code and import the databases in a test environment with full operational capabilities.
