# Databases for Developers - Final Project

## The assignment is to develop the backend part of a web application with three databases. 
You need to implement 3 solutions:  
➢Relational database  
➢Document database  
➢Graph database  

### The project should contain the following elements:  
➢Database design for all three databases  
➢ERD of the relational database  
➢Test data in all tables  
➢Protection from SQL injection  
➢Transactions  
➢Stored objects (Views, Stored procedures, Stored functions, Triggers, Events)  
➢An audit solution involving these triggers  
➢Definition of users and privileges at database level (admin, read only user, user with limited read privileges, application with minimum functional privileges)  
➢A CRUD application with search options, and optionally some queries relating to business logic  
➢API (documentation with Swagger or similar)  
➢Cloud deployment (optional)  
➢Integration tests (between the backend and databases)  
➢Documentation 

### General Requirements:    
➢Databases should be complex enough to cover the curriculum of the whole course. For example, a relational database should have at least 10 tables.  
➢Not all functionality needs to be implemented for all three databases.  
➢The focus will be on the database and the backend server. Frontend is not part of the project. Use Postman, Swagger UI, etc. to simulate the interaction with a web client.
➢Databases can be hosted on the same web server or different ones.  
➢Choice of tech stack is up to the group.  

### Project Delivery:  
➢Individually to WISEflow.  
➢Project Report that serves as information to the external censor. Report structure in the full assignment document.    
➢A link to the code base in a publicly accessible repository.  
➢Relational database scripts.  
➢Dump file of the document database and Script for loading the test data.  
➢Dump file of the graph database and Script for loading the test data.  
➢A brief installation guide that specifies how to organise the code and import the databases in a test environment with full operational capabilities.

### Databases for Developers - Exam
The exam will be oral, externally censored, and graded according to the 7-grade scale:
grading scale
### The exam will take a maximum of 30 minutes per student:
➢ Project presentation (PowerPoint presentation + demo): 10 min. The final project will be 
developed in groups, but it will be presented individually.
➢ Questions by the examiner and the censor: 15 min 
➢ Grading: 5min
### Each individual grade will be based on:
➢ Quality of the final project
➢ Project report
➢ Performance at the exam (presentation + questions)

Students will bring their laptops to the exam. The documentation must be already open, and 
the application and the database servers must be running before the exam starts - otherwise
the time spent in opening/starting them will count as the exam time.
To present the project and to answer examiner’s and censor’s questions, students will be free 
to use whichever tool they consider appropriate.

### The project presentation will consist of:
➢ A demonstration of the CRUD application from a functional perspective (one can use 
swagger, postman, etc.)
➢ A brief explanation of the relational database solution, including design and 
implementation decisions.
➢ A brief explanation of the document database solution, including design and 
implementation decisions.
➢ A brief explanation of the graph database solution, including design and implementation 
decisions.

Examiner and censor can ask questions regarding any part of the project or the subject’s
curriculum. They can also request the student to perform live coding (for example 
create/update/execute SQL statements, stored procedures and functions, triggers, user 
management, NoSQL queries etc.).

Note: The external censor will mainly focus on the final report to make sure it fully covers the 
final project requirements.
